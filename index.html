   Cryptology is the study and deciphering of codes. ‘It includes both cryptography and cryptanalysis.’ <a href="#Simmons, G.J, 2019">Simmons, G.J, 2019</a>.  
   ‘Cryptography uses mathematical techniques to transform data and prevent it from being read or tampered with.’ <a href="#Robin Materese, 2016">Robin Materese, 2016</a>. 
   This means preventing people from looking at the information who are not supposed to. 
   ‘Cryptanalysis is the understanding of ciphers and how they work and finding and improving techniques for defeating or weakening them.’ <a href="#Rosencrance, L, 2021">Rosencrance, L, 2021</a>.
      </pre>
  </p>
    <h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      <pre>  
    The first cipher machine is the German Enigma machine which was used by the Third Reich during WW2. 
    The way it worked is that you ‘enter the first letter of your message on the keyboard and a letter lights up 
    showing what it has been replaced within the encrypted message.’ <a href="#Hern, A, 2014">Hern, A, 2014</a>. This will cause 
    ‘one or more rotors move to form a new rotor configuration which will encode one letter as another’ <a href="#Moore, K, 2016">Moore, K, 2016</a>. 
    This gave it a combination of ‘150 million million - combinations of 10 pairs of 26 letters on the plug board.’ <a href="#plus.maths.org, 2005">plus.maths.org, 2005</a>. 
    The enigma machine ‘had three revolving rotors that could be taken out and changed about.’ <a href="#plus.maths.org, 2005">plus.maths.org, 2005</a>. 
    This is an early example of a private or public key that is used nowadays to access the encoded data. The German Enigma machine was considered inpregnable until Alan Turing and his 
    colleagues were able to crack it by finding how the enigma machine was coded.

     <p>
      <pre>
    Symmetric key cryptography:
    ‘The symmetric key cryptography is also known as private key. It states that both the sender and the receiver recipient must have a single key 
    in order to encrypt or decrypt the message.’ <a href="#Kikani, R.J., Verma, K., Navalakhe, R., Shrivastava, G. and Shrivastava, V, 2021">Kikani, R.J., Verma, K., Navalakhe, R., Shrivastava, G. and Shrivastava, V, 2021</a>. 
    ‘A key is a random series of binary digits or bits designed to scramble and unscramble transmitted data.’ <a href="#Komodo Wallet, 2022">Komodo Wallet, 2022</a>.
    A bit is the smallest unit of binary that a computer can store. The key is dependent on ‘length and randomness as they are major factors used to 
    determine the strength of a symmetric encryption algorithm’ <a href="#Komodo Wallet, 2022">Komodo Wallet, 2022</a>. The longer the length of the key, the greater the randomness; 
    the harder it is to decrypt.  Symmetric key cryptography is ‘commonly used in banking and data storage applications to eliminate fraudulent charges
    and prevent identity theft’ <a href="#Komodo Wallet, 2022">Komodo Wallet, 2022</a>. The reason why it is so common in banking is that the bank can easily change the key resulting
    in your money being protected. 

    Asymmetric key cryptography:
    'Asymmetric cryptography uses pairs of keys – a private one kept secret and a public one' <a href="#Sarwade, S, 2023">Sarwade, S, 2023</a> the public is able to be used by anyone to encrypt a 
    message but only the owner of the public key decrypt it. <a href="#Sarwade, S, 2023">Sarwade, S, 2023</a>. 'Asymmetric requires both the sender and the 
    receiver to go through the encryption and decryption process' <a href="#Kikani, R.J., Verma, K., Navalakhe, R., Shrivastava, G. and Shrivastava, V, 2021">Kikani, R.J., Verma, K., Navalakhe, R., Shrivastava, G. and Shrivastava, V, 2021</a>.

    Hash function:
    Hash function is the third type of cryptography used nowadays and it is ‘a mathematical function that coverts data into a string with a fixed 
    number of characters.’ <a href="#Loo, A, 2022">Loo, A, 2022</a>. This cryptography does not require a key as ‘its is a one-way operation which means it’s 
    impossible to compute the input from a particular output.’ <a href="#Mehmood (guest), A, (n.d.)">Mehmood (guest), A, (n.d.)</a>.

    Due to the modern world becoming more digital, cryptology is becoming ever more important in everyday lives to protect a person or companies’ 
    personal information. It is believed that Quantum computers are the future. ‘Quantum computers use properties of quantum mechanics to compute in a 
    fundamentally different way from today's digital, 'classical', computers.’ <a href="#www.ncsc.gov.uk, n.d.">www.ncsc.gov.uk, n.d.</a>. Quantum computers are able to use quantum mechanics 
    which allows it to ‘create multidimensional computational spaces. This is a much more efficient way of solving complex problems’ <a href="#IBM, 2022">IBM, 2022</a>. 
    Quantum computers are able to do this because ‘computers process quantum bits, a two-state quantum-mechanical system, called qubits.’ 
    <a href="#Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering, n.d.">Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering, n.d.</a>. ‘A classical binary bit can only represent a 0 or 1, meaning that it can only be in one of two 
    possible states.' <a href="#azure.microsoft.com, n.d.">azure.microsoft.com, n.d.</a>. However the difference is that a 'qubit can represent a 0, a 1, or any proportion of 0 and 1 in superposition of both states, with a certain probability of 
    being a 0 and a certain probability of being a 1.’ <a href="#azure.microsoft.com, n.d.">azure.microsoft.com, n.d.</a>. Quantum computers nowadays 
    have ‘high error rates’ <a href="#www.ncsc.gov.uk, n.d.">www.ncsc.gov.uk, n.d.</a> resulting in the tasks not being performed correctly. 
    However, in the future ‘most traditional public key cryptography algorithms in use today will be vulnerable to attacks from it.’ <a href="#www.ncsc.gov.uk, n.d.">www.ncsc.gov.uk, n.d.</a>.

    In conclusion cryptology has changed a lot over a short period ranging from physically having to encode the data yourself and choosing what the key is to nowadays where the computers do it for you. 
    The future of cryptology seems even more different as its believed that everything nowadays can be easily decrypted by quantum computers as they are able to view things in multiple dimensions.  
    This has resulted in countries investing heavily into quantum computers. It is predicted that China will ‘spend more on quantum research than any other nation by 2030’. <a href="#www.nationaldefensemagazine.org, n.d.">www.nationaldefensemagazine.org, n.d.</a>
    This highlights the growing importance of quantum computers and how they are so efficient and effective in doing their tasks which is why they will be used more often in the future.
